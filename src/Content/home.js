const homeP1 = `I am a recent graduate from the School of Code where I have spent the last four months on an intensive boot camp studying 
full-stack web development. The course had a heavy focus on working as part of team to both learn new concepts and deliver well engineered products.`

const homeP2 = `These last four months have imparted on me a love of React and Node.js and I enjoy logically breaking down problems and 
planning out the flow of state or how a function needs to behave to return the desired result. I am now looking for my first junior role in this 
sector and hope to continue this journey and build on the skills I have learnt so far.`

const homeP3 = `I have always enjoyed problem solving and my first exposure to code was automating simple tasks in excel. 
I was able to streamline many of my tasks and I built a number 
tools to make work for myself and my teams easier. This gave me a small glimpse of how powerful code can be.`

const homeP4 = `I am a proud father of an amazing son and I want to demonstrate to him that you can achieve anything you set your mind to.
When I'm not spending time with my family or improving on my newly acquired coding skills I am a keen gamer. I enjoy Path of Exile and StarCraft II,
both games, but especially StarCraft, require a lot of reflection to iterate and improve and that is something I try to carry into every part of 
my life.`
