export const homeTitle = `A little about me`

export const homeP1 = `I am a recent graduate from the School of Code where I have spent the last four months on an intensive bootcamp studying 
full-stack web development. The course had a heavy focus on working as part of team to both learn new concepts and deliver well engineered projects, 
both on Friday "hackathons" and two large projects.`

export const homeP2 = `The first of these being a one week project in a team of four and the second a one month project in a team of six. Both of 
these projects were extremely fun and we were able to work in an Agile way to deliver a final product we were all proud of. At times the group was 
not always in agreement about the best way forward but we were able to resolve any differences in a professional and efficient manner through 
compromise, discussion and occasionally voting to resolve any deadlocks.`

export const homeP3 = `These last four months have imparted on me a love of React and Node.js and I enjoy logically breaking down problems and 
planning out the flow of state or how a function needs to behave to return the desired result.`

export const homeP4 = `I am now looking for my first junior role in this sector and hope to continue this journey and continue building on 
the skills I have learnt on this course.`
